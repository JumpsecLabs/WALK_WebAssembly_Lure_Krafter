# What, Why?


This is the tool I developed off the back of the recent research I‚Äôve done into crafting web smuggling lures using web assembly. You can read the accompanying blogpost "[WASM Smuggling for Initial Access and W.A.L.K. Tool Release](https://labs.jumpsec.com/wasm-smuggling-for-initial-access-and-w-a-l-k-tool-release/)" on [JUMPSEC Labs](https://labs.jumpsec.com/).

# Setup


## Install Rust

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# source the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"   
```

## Install `wasm-pack` and `wasm-bindgen-cli`

```bash
cargo install -f wasm-pack wasm-bindgen-cli

# add cargo to path
# zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
# bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

```

> üöß **For Arch / Manjaro  users**
> 
> Install base-devel dependency first
> `sudo pacman -Syu && sudo pacman -S base-devel`


**Open New Terminal or use Source command to enable wasm-pack binary path**

```bash
# replace with zshrc if you are using zsh
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Clone, Build and Run W.A.L.K.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JumpsecLabs/WALK_WebAssembly_Lure_Krafter.git
cd WALK_WebAssembly_Lure_Krafter
```

From the project's root folder run:

```bash
cargo run
```

# Use


The Web Assembly Lure Krafter is quite straightforward to use. Just execute `cargo run` from the project‚Äôs folder. The tool will ask you to select a lure to generate.

  <img src="imgs/Untitled1.png" alt="The Web Assembly Lure Krafter" />
</p>
Select the lure template you want to use, then the tool will ask you to enter the following:

- Select the lure to generate.
- Enter the payload‚Äôs extension. This can be anything but should match the extension of your payload.
- Enter the absolute file path of the payload to smuggle.
- Enter the payload name (without the extension at the end).

The tool will then compile and generate a lure based on the template selected and embed the payload file you provided the path for.

  <img src="imgs/Untitled2.png" alt="W.A.L.K. Menu" />
</p>
Each lure that W.A.L.K. generates is stored in a sub-directory of the `results/` directory, presenting a timestamp and a random string in the name. The generated lure will consist in a single `index.html` file stored in its timestamped sub-directory contained in `results/`. The `index.html` is the only file you will need as it contains the Web Assembly lure and the payload embedded within it.

</p>
This file can be sent over email or chat without triggering anti-virus scans or security measures, effectively flying under the radar at the time of writing. To the end-user is left the arduous task to determine the best way to share their lures. 

# Lure Templates

W.A.L.K. comes pre-packed with some lures, namely:

- Google Chrome Update
- One Drive File Download
- Sample

However, as described next, it is possible to add extra lure templates to the tool and use them in your engagement. At the moment, these are the lure I developed for the tool:

## Google Chrome Update

This lure was designed to simulate a Google Chrome browser update request from an I.T. department. The payload download is triggered when the ‚ÄúUpdate Chrome‚Äù button is clicked.

## One Drive File Download

This web assembly lure was designed to simulate a OneDrive file download. The lure presents the screen shown below and sleeps for `4 seconds` before automatically downloading the payload.

## Sample

It‚Äôs just a sample web page with no contents that automatically downloads the payloads you embedded in it. 

# Modularity

W.A.L.K. was designed to be modular and be able to create new lures based on template files located in `lure_templates/` . By adding more lures in the `lure_templates/` directory it is possible to then call the template from the tool‚Äôs  menu by adding an entry to it in `src/main.rs`.

Once you add a `.rs` template file in `lure_templates/`, modify the `src/main.rs` file‚Äôs menu by adding an entry for the new template in `fn main()`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/Untitled5.png" alt="Modularity1" />
</p>
The menu entry will trigger the searching for the relevant file using the following logic. 
<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/Untitled6.png" alt="Modularity2" />
</p>
This means that if you add a menu entry such as "New Lure" and then select it from the menu, W.A.L.K. will go look for a file names "new_lure.rs" file inside the `lure_templates/` directory.
For example, when selecting the ‚ÄúGoogle Chrome Update‚Äù lure from the menu, W.A.L.K. will look for `google_chrome_update.rs` in the `lure_templates/` directory.
